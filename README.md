### T-Watch-2020-V2\TTGOWatchNmeaWriter
A very basic example write NMEA messages and to read/process all NMEA messages, received from the L76K.

The main reason of the code is, writing the receiver configuration. With this part (line 123-141) the configuration can be changes, to receive GPS + BeiDou + GLONASS messages.

Processing all NMEA messages is not yet complete and some functions are created only to avoid errors being displayed.
